# Dependencies used
- bootstrap, quantize 
- Tried to install dependency for getting the dominant color but none worked for me, so took the part of functionalties from `color-thief` node package and installed the `quantize` and tried to get the dominant color from image.

# Deployment
- Deployed on Heroku by using express,
- express is a framework for building web applications on node, so because on the back end we are using express so installed express dependencies as well.
